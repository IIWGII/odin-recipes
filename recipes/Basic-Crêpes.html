    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This simple but delicious crêpe recipe can be made in minutes from
      ingredients that everyone has on hand.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in
        milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat
        until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour
        or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
        each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats
        the surface evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has
        turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the
        skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has
        turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
