    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she
      wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. <br />
      Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home.
      I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. <br />
      These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll
      pan.
